- Deep links to WhatsApp, Google Calendar, Email, and Spotify
- Weekly auto-reset of checkmarks (configurable day)
- Progress bar with confetti celebration

## Tech Stack

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks. Uses localStorage for persistence and a service worker for offline PWA support.
